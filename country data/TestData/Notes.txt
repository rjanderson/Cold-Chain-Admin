Document files have CDATA Fields 
The first CDATA field is the name of the data field - suggest that this is manually editted to replace as a text string

The other CDATA fields are HTML Tables with admin data
First remove the CDATA Fields.   There appear to be a couple of Meta lines which can be removed
